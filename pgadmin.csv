8,FOOLS DIE - BY MARIO PUZO,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922343i/22035.jpg,"The novel opens with one of recent fiction''s most captivating first chapters, introducing three '"degenerate gamblers'" in 1959 Las Vegas: casino informant Cully, intensely boyish Merlyn, and middle-aged runaway Jordan, who wins a fortune then immediately commits suicide. While Jordan''s ironic victory lingers as a haunting presence, the narrative settles on Merlyn, whose appeal diminishes proportionally to his rising success. Living in the Bronx with his family while pursuing writing through an Army Reserves job, Merlyn initially engages readers through his gambling binges and corrupt practices, culminating in his self-described status as '"the Tiffany''s of bribe-takers.'" His partnership with Cully to launder money provides some of the book''s strongest moments. However, once Merlyn achieves literary celebrity, the novel loses narrative drive and resorts to tired conventions - the composite hard-drinking writer figure spouting Hemingway-esque lines, Hollywood corruption tropes, and an affair with a stereotypical '"liberated'" bisexual actress. While Puzo clearly intends to examine significant themes about survival, artistic integrity, and relationships, the novel only truly achieves the '"magic'" of writing it celebrates during scenes of financial exchange and manipulation.",2025-08-03,8
